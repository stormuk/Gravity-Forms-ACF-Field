Gravity-Forms-ACF-Field
=======================

This is an Advanced Custom Field custom field to select one or many [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityhelp.com/).

This provides a field that lets you select from a list of active Gravity Forms.

Compatibility
============

This add-on will work with:

* version 4
* Version 5

Installation
============

This add-on can be treated as both a WP plugin and a theme include.

*Plugin*
1. Copy the 'Gravity-Forms-ACF-field' folder into your plugins folder
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins admin page

*Include*
1.  Copy the 'Gravity-Forms-ACF-field' folder into your theme folder (can use sub folders). You can place the folder anywhere inside the 'wp-content' directory
2.  Edit your functions.php file and add the code below (Make sure the path is correct to include the acf-gravity_forms.php file)

```
  include_once('acf-gravity_forms.php');
```

Using the field
===============

The field lets you pick one or many fields.

The data returned is either a Form object, an array of [Form objects](http://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/page/Form_Object) or false if an error occurred.

If you have selected a single form and you want to display the form on the page, you can use:

```
<?php 
    $form_object = get_field('your_form_field');
    gravity_form_enqueue_scripts($form_object['id'], true);
    gravity_form($form_object['id'], true, true, false, '', true, 1); 
?>
```

or

```
<?php 
    $form_object = get_field('your_form_field');
    echo do_shortcode('[gravityform id="' . $form_object['id'] . '" title="true" description="true" ajax="true"]');
?>
```

You can find out more about the gravity_form method to embed a form on a page in their [documentation](http://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/page/Embedding_A_Form)

If you are using the field to select multiple forms, you will have to iterate over the array.  You can then use the form object as you like:

```
<?php
    $form_objects = get_field('your_forms');
  
    foreach($form_objects as $form){
        echo $form['title'];  
    }
?>
```
